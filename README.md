# Chrome_Dino_Game
#
#
# This is the code for arduino to automate the dinosaur game in google chrome.
#
# Componensts needed:
 * Arduino Uno or nano
 * SG90 Micro-servo motor
 * Light Dipendent Resistior 
 * 10k ohm resistor


# Instructions
For this project we use arduino uno or nano, micro-servo, 10k ohm resietor and a light dependent resistor. Light dependent resistor(LDR) is a type of resistor which changes
the resistance value with the intensity of light. When the cactus or the dark part of the game is in front of the LDR, then the LDR gives a signal to the Arduino pin A0 and 
the Arduino gives a signal to the digitel pin 9 to turn on the servo motor. The servo motor should be placed in such a way that when it is activated the motor should press 
the button on the keyboard.

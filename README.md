# Chrome_Dino_Game
#
#
# This is the code for arduino to automate the dinosaur game in google chrome.
#
# Componensts needed:
* Arduino Uno or nano
* SG90 Micro-servo motor
* Light Dipendent Resistior 
* 10k ohm resistor


# Instructions
For this project we use arduino uno or nano, micro-servo, 10k ohm resietor and a light dependent resistor. Light dependent resistor(LDR) is a type of resistor which changes
the resistance value with the intensity of light.
